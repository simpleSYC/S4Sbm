Service For Service buisness modeal (S4Sbm)
 \n 
S4Sbm is one new idea that is win-win solution on bouth sides clients and buisness
 \n 
its just private agriment that they make betwhine they without any thirty party, hiden fees etc..
 \n 
thye just simple make deal that 1 side will do service for other side in excange for free servise from other side
 \n 
that is its..
 \n 
alos main point is that bout side to dont involvt money inveistment in case if one of they cant do some  tricky mouves
 \n 
this idea is alredy in use but in still unknow to mass of people. Litel bit more famose about that is some 
 \n 
univerity and/or agency offer oportynity for students from other contuers
 \n 
to work in hotle (as recepcion ) in reward to get free housing at hotel. also some sezonjobs and turis agency ofer that,,
 \n 
so the point of S4Sbm is just to preform that as normal thing. if you offer service that cant be taken then you cant loose money
 \n 
(ex. cant steal the talent form some artist that preform that in live)
 \n 
, but if is service that containt some kind of sicrets (ex. magician/recept preform can loose value if everybody know the sicret)
 \n 
the concept is good because in heige percent by defalt this system you cant lose money if dont invest money.
 \n 
also if this concept is menagent in right wey, you can teoretcly gain more progres in long run and do more enjoifull things that you wanna
 \n 
(for better understanding the concept see the video below.)
 \n 


so bottom line , people that are more energetly , talentd , enterpneuere , have some idea and time , with out money and risk can feel the benefits 
from S4Sbm.

This is Maria.
She works in call-center as secretare.
She isnt very satesfacted with his job
and wanna somehow to focus on his hobby-talent
job as freelancer city exterior photographer.
But dont know how to promote without hevy inveistment


This is Bob.
He is hotel owner and menager.
He wanna somhow to incrise profit
But dont know how to promote without hevy inveistment.

This is Robinzo.
He work as deser chef in local small mini-restorant.
He wanna to sell online courese and teaching new chefs coocking deserts
But dont know how to promote without hevy inveistment

....
so all have some problem in promote theyr beasnusse . and lack of money play part of demotivation theyr goal ..


so Maria know about S4Sbm and wanna to give a try to that method.

She contac Bob and ask for privare deal.
she ask to work as repceptioner as ekstra job
in return 
to be his photos promoting in Bob's hotel.


Bob know that this is gold oportyniti beacause save on payment and can invest that in marketing
but he need to chek if the photos will have good vision in hotel hale,,

so if they agreed about deall they can make privat contract deall vetwine they


also Robinzo have the seam S4Sbm idea and contact Bob.
He asking for 1 hour pro week to use hotel big kitchen with his group 
in return
to give Bob some (ex 10 cake pro week ) profesionall desert cake that are baked with her teaching class group


Bob also agein see golden opirtinity that can add ekstra dessert in his kitchen meny 

but just need to calculate the cost and offer of cake per week deal with Robinzo.

so if they agreed about deall they can make privat contract deall vetwine they




Bob is smart. He dont need to make money from Maria and Robinzo, he can use theyr work in his promote expensive marketing 
that can generate more money form normal clients








so that is just one simple example of S4Sbm.

Jobs of Maria, Bob and Robinzo cann be any other work that just need somehow to have boute benefits without risk of investment
